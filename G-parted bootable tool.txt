1)Navigate to https://distrowatch.com/ 
2)In the top right you will see a box with a drop-down arrow, click the arrow and scroll till you see G-parted and select
3) Note: this site is great for Linux info on distro's as well as links for related Linux software and links to help wiki's
4)Find the link to the home page and go
5) note:please read over the site and download ISO
6) note:This is and boot-able partition manager that will help wipe drives,format them,and many more things(please look over the site before using this software) I'm including to how-to because its a handy tool when it comes to doing fresh installs for my "How-To's" on installing OS's
7)If your using Windows navigate to Rufus and download and run disk formatting software
8)If your using a Linux system that system will have a command-line tool called fdisk but i recommend "Mate Disks" if your perfer a gui
9)Rufus presets are already for you, select the ISO and start, to make boot-able drive
10)If your using "disks" there is a man page that will help u, from the command line type "man fdisk"
11)Now that you have a boot-able USB, boot into it and apply as needed for your needs
12Good luck!
