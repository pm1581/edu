Hi my name is Pete and this repo is Linux based walk-thru's that I put together as part of my school project.
These are documents of software that I have used through-out my time here  at TSTC.I hope they help others that
might be entering the IT feild or just want to explore open-source.Everything on here is geared towords Linux
systems and open-source. I owe my new found intrest for Linux to two great teachers at TSTC that not only
taught me but encourage me to explore Linux.Thank you to those very special teachers.
